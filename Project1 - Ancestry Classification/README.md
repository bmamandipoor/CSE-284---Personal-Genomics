Title: Advanced Ancestry Classification Through Machine Learning 
Problem: The project addresses the significant challenge of leveraging Single Nucleotide Polymorphism (SNP) data for accurate ancestry prediction. 
The high dimensionality of SNP data, where the feature space significantly surpasses the number of samples, introduces complexity in model training, leading to potential overfitting and reduced prediction accuracy. 
This project proposes a novel approach to enhance classification performance by integrating dimensionality reduction techniques within a machine learning based framework.
